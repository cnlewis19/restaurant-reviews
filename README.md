## Instructions

This app requires a simple Python server to run. If needed, change the port information in dbhelper.js to run on your local server. Due to this being published on Github, the MapBox API key has been removed. Please use your own MapBox api key. There is a spot that says <insert MapBox API key> on both the main.js page and the restaurant_info.js page. 

All other dependencies including LeafLet are included in the index.html file.
